nqueen_hill_climbing.py contains the solution for the first task of the project.
Before running this script, it is neccessary to have installed the following Python libraries:
- tkinter
- numpy
- time

to run this script, open cmd in the directory where the file is located and run: python nqueen_hill_climbing.py
It is expected to show a small frame where you type the number of queens for which you want to test the solution
and after pressing the Solve button, it will show another frame solving the N Queen Problem in GUI.

classification_problem.ipynb is a jupyter notebook that contains the solution for the second task of the assignment.
Run it as you run any other .ipynb file (I have jupyter it integrated on my VSCode). 
There are several libraries needed to have before running the code:
- pandas
- scipy.io
- sklearn
- time
- matplotlib
